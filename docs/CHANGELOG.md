  - `/complete` endpoint auto-promotes through intermediate statuses (in_dev → in_ci → testing → done)
  - Rewrote `/implement` skill: push → PR → CI → smoke/E2E → merge → done
  - Updated `/e2e-run` skill URLs from `/api/tasks/` → `/api/runs/` post-rename
  - Alembic migration for in_ci status rename + need_e2e column
  - 10 new unit tests, 3 flow tests, service test updates

## 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Rename WorkItem→Task, Task→Run** (#64): Full entity rename across codebase.
  - Planning layer: `WorkItem` → `Task` (table `work_items` → `tasks`, ID prefix `wi-` → `task-`)
  - Execution layer: `Task` → `Run` (table `tasks` → `runs`)
  - API routes: `/api/work-items/` → `/api/tasks/`, `/api/tasks/` → `/api/runs/`
  - Alembic migration renames tables and FK columns in correct order
  - All models, schemas, routers, workers, tests, scripts, and skill files updated
  - ~48 files changed, ~1950 insertions, ~1925 deletions

### Added
- **Milestone model + ROADMAP generation** (#63): Milestones as DB entities to group work items into phases/epics.
  - `Milestone` SQLAlchemy model (id, project_id, title, description, sort_order, status, parent_id, created_by)
  - `MilestoneStatus` DTO with transitions (open -> completed)
  - `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/milestones/` — CRUD endpoints with project_id/status filters
  - `POST /api/milestones/{id}/complete` — action endpoint with transition validation
  - `GET /api/milestones/{id}/work-items` — sub-resource listing
  - `WorkItem.milestone_id` FK — links work items to milestones
  - `?milestone_id=X` filter on work items list endpoint
  - Alembic migration for `milestones` table + `work_items.milestone_id` column
  - `scripts/generate_roadmap.py` + `make roadmap` — generates ROADMAP.md from API
  - `scripts/seed_milestones.py` — one-time migration of existing ROADMAP phases
  - 33 unit tests (DTO, model, schemas, router, roadmap formatter)
- **Brainstorm model in DB** (#61): Brainstorms as first-class DB entities instead of markdown-only files.
  - `Brainstorm` SQLAlchemy model with status state machine (draft → done → triaged → archived)
  - `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/brainstorms/` — CRUD endpoints
  - `POST /api/brainstorms/{id}/done|triage|archive` — action endpoints with transition validation
  - `WorkItem.source_brainstorm_id` FK — links work items back to originating brainstorm
  - Alembic migration for `brainstorms` table + FK column
  - Updated `/brainstorm` and `/triage` skills to use API
  - 30 unit tests (DTO, model, schemas, router), 3 integration tests
- **Skills → API + Simplified Model** (#58): All skills now use Work Items API instead of markdown files.
  - `plan` text field on WorkItem model + migration
  - `COMMENT` event type (Jira-style discussion); removed `STEP_START`/`STEP_DONE`
  - `GET /api/work-items/stats` — status counts
  - `GET /api/work-items/next-tag` — next available backlog tag number
  - `GET /api/work-items/?since=<datetime>` — filter by updated_at
  - `project_id` and `plan` fields on `WorkItemUpdate` schema
  - `scripts/generate_backlog.py` + `make backlog` — generate backlog.md from API
  - `docs/ideas.md` — standalone Ideas file (read by make backlog)
  - Updated `/plan`, `/implement`, `/triage`, `/checkpoint` skills to use API
  - `/next` skill removed (absorbed into `/implement`)
  - 12 new service tests for API v2 endpoints
- **`/implement` emits work item events** (#57): `/implement` skill now writes `step_start`/`step_done` events via `POST /api/work-items/{id}/events` at each plan step, and calls `/complete` on task finish. New `step_start`/`step_done` event types in `WorkItemEventType`. `/next` now writes `WorkItem` ID to STATUS.md for downstream skills.
- **`/next` skill via Work Items API** (#56): First skill migrated from markdown parsing to API. `/next` now picks tasks via `GET /api/work-items/?status=backlog&limit=1` and starts them via `POST /api/work-items/{id}/start`.
  - `limit` and `sort` query params on list endpoint
  - `GET /api/work-items/by-tag/{tag}` — lookup by backlog tag (e.g. `#53`)
  - 5 service tests for the `/next` flow
- **WorkItem task management system** (#55): Planning layer for tracking features/fixes with agile statuses (backlog → todo → in_dev → testing → done). Models: `WorkItem`, `WorkItemEvent`. Action-based API with state machine validation. Alembic migration, 25+ unit tests, service tests, backlog migration script.
  - `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/work-items/` — CRUD
  - `POST /api/work-items/{id}/start|complete|fail|reopen|transition` — state machine actions
  - `GET/POST /api/work-items/{id}/events` — event history
  - `Task.work_item_id` + `Task.iteration` — links execution to planning layer
  - `scripts/migrate_backlog.py` — migrates backlog.md Queue into DB

### Fixed
- **Secrets not persisting**: `POST /projects/{id}/config/secrets` returned 200 but never saved. Root cause: plain `JSON` column didn't detect in-place dict mutations. Fix: `MutableDict.as_mutable(JSON)` on `Project.config` and `project_spec` columns + `dict()` copy in `merge_secrets` (#51)
- **Project stuck in "deploying"**: deploy-worker didn't reset project status on `missing_user_secrets`. Now rolls back to `failed` (#51)
- **API service tests event_loop**: replaced deprecated `event_loop` fixture with `asyncio_default_test_loop_scope=session` to fix "Future attached to a different loop" errors (#51)
- Description loss in create flow: `trigger_engineering` now PATCHes `detailed_spec` into project config for `action=create` (#50)
- `_build_create_task` uses `feature_description` from queue as fallback when `detailed_spec` is missing (#50)
- PO prompt updated to pass description to both `create_project` and `trigger_engineering` (#50)

## 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- Corrupted checkpoint recovery: PO consumer auto-repairs orphan tool_calls that block users permanently (#48)
- `ruff.toml` per-file-ignores now covers `**/tests/**` paths (services tests were getting PLR2004 false positives) (#48)
- Race condition in `set_project_secret` when LLM calls it in parallel — secrets no longer lost (#47)
- `test_post_projects_pure_db` integration test — add `X-Telegram-ID` header and seed user via API (#42)

### Changed
- `set_project_secret` PO tool uses single POST instead of GET→decrypt→merge→encrypt→PATCH (#47)
- `_save_secrets_to_project` in devops nodes delegates to `api_client.merge_secrets` (#47)
- `owner_id` on projects is now NOT NULL — every project must have an owner (#39)
- `POST /api/projects/` returns 400 if `X-Telegram-ID` header is missing (#39)
- `github_sync` no longer creates orphan projects — sends admin notification for unknown repos (#39)
- Webhook removes `if project.owner_id` guard — owner always exists (#39)
- `ProjectDTO.owner_id` is now `int` (was `int | None`), `ProjectRead` includes `owner_id` (#39)

### Removed
- `ProjectUpdate.owner_id` field — owner is immutable after creation (#39)
- `SchedulerAPIClient.create_project()` — scheduler no longer creates projects (#39)

### Added
- Workspace failure counter: tracks consecutive failures per project in Redis (#8)
- Force workspace wipe after 2 consecutive failures — broken state auto-recovery (#8)
- Spawn rejection after 3 consecutive failures — circuit breaker with auto-unblock (TTL 48h) (#8)
- `reason` field on `DeleteWorkerCommand` — `completed`/`failed`/`timeout` for failure tracking (#8)
- `--feature` mode in e2e-run skill: triggers `action=feature` after initial create+deploy, verifies no scaffold, monitors feature CI+deploy (#34)
- Feature Add Matrix in e2e-run skill: per-test feature descriptions for all 7 test cases (#34)
- Unit tests for `action=feature/fix` flow in DeveloperNode and engineering worker (#34)
- `GET /projects/by-repo-id/{repo_id}` — lookup project by GitHub repo ID, used by scheduler github_sync (#33)
- `GET /servers/{handle}/ssh-key` — returns decrypted SSH private key per server (#33)
- `PATCH /servers/{handle}` accepts `ssh_key` field — encrypts with Fernet and stores (#33)
- Provisioner auto-saves SSH key to DB after successful provisioning (#33)
- `LanggraphAPIClient.get_server_ssh_key()` — fetches per-server SSH key (#33)
- `_ssh_key_tempfile()` context manager for secure temporary SSH key files (#33)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` — production overlay (no direct API port, restart policies, Redis AOF, no DB defaults) (#32)
- `infra/scripts/pull-worker-images.sh` — pulls worker base images from GHCR and retags to local names (#32)
- `infra/scripts/backup-db.sh` + systemd timer — daily pg_dump with 7-day rotation (#32)
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — full production deployment guide with GitHub Secrets inventory (#32)

### Changed
- DeployerNode reads SSH key from DB (per-server) instead of mounted file (#33)
- `run_ssh_command()` accepts `ssh_key` content parameter instead of reading from `Paths.SSH_KEY` (#33)
- `docker-compose.yml`: parameterized `SSH_KEY_PATH` and `GITHUB_APP_PEM_PATH` with dev defaults (#32)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: complete rewrite — writes all env vars, builds images, pulls worker images from GHCR, runs migrations, health checks (#32)

### Removed
- SSH volume mounts (`~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro`) from langgraph, deploy-worker, scheduler, infra-service (#33)
- `Paths.SSH_KEY` from `shared/constants.py` — no longer needed (#33)
- `ORCHESTRATOR_SSH_KEY` secret from deploy.yml — per-server keys in DB now (#33)

### Fixed
- CI: service test matrix `changed` field was literal string, not `${{ }}` expression — tests were silently skipped on every run since #4 (#38)
- API: make `X-Telegram-ID` optional for project creation — system calls (scheduler github_sync) create discovered projects with `owner_id=None` (#38)
- Service test `test_pure_crud`: removed unnecessary `X-Telegram-ID` header (test verifies no side effects, not ownership) (#38)
- Service test `test_service_db_smoke`: fixed event loop mismatch caused by session-scoped DB engine (#38)

## 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- Atomic port allocation: `UniqueConstraint(server_handle, port)` + `POST /ports/allocate-next` endpoint with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` — eliminates TOCTOU race in parallel deploys (#31)

### Removed
- Dead `ports.py` PO tools (`allocate_port`, `get_next_available_port`) and `PortAllocationResult` schema — replaced by atomic allocation in `allocator.py` (#31)

### Fixed
- Multi-user isolation: PO tools now pass `X-Telegram-ID` header in all API calls (#30)
- API requires `X-Telegram-ID` for project creation — prevents orphan projects with `owner_id=NULL` (#30)
- Workers pass user's telegram_id to API when fetching projects, enabling ownership checks (#30)
- `LanggraphAPIClient.get_project()` and `list_projects()` accept optional `telegram_id` param (#30)

### Changed
- Replaced last "Zavhoz agent" reference with "ResourceAllocatorNode" in `AllocatedResource` docstring (#12)
- Clarified engineering-worker and deploy-worker as Redis stream consumers of the langgraph image, not independent services, across CLAUDE.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md (#12)
- CI integration tests: sequential → 5 parallel matrix jobs (backend, cli, template, frontend, infra) (#4)
- Per-suite change detection: each integration suite only runs when relevant files changed (#4)
- Healthcheck intervals 5s→2s in non-DIND test compose files (frontend, infra, cli) (#4)
- Per-suite Docker buildx cache keys for better cache hits (#4)

### Removed
- Dead `list_repos.py` debug script from langgraph service (#17) — 72 LOC, standalone script with `sys.path` hack and `print()`
- Legacy name-based project lookup fallback in github_sync (#17) — `get_project_by_name` from scheduler API client + fallback in `_sync_single_repo`
- Dead CLI agent config infrastructure (#36): `CLIAgentNode`, `cli_agent_config_cache`, CLI agent config API router/schema/ORM model, alembic migration — 423 LOC deleted
- Dead `architect_complete` field from `OrchestratorState` and provisioner init (#37)
- Vestigial references to removed agents (architect, Zavhoz, product_owner, brainstorm, developer) in comments/docstrings (#37)

### Fixed
- Fail fast with `RuntimeError` when `ORCHESTRATOR_USER_ID` not set in CLI commands (#29) — was silently defaulting to `"unknown"`, breaking audit trail

### Changed
- Defensive init `smoke_result: None` in `_build_subgraph_input` (#25) — consistent with other Optional fields
- Diagnostic logging `devops_subgraph_result` in deploy_worker after `ainvoke()` — for #25 root cause investigation
- Updated `/e2e-run` skill to check deploy-worker logs for smoke diagnostics

### Added
- E2E report: todo_api with-PO mode PASS (12 min) — first test with PO creating project via Redis Streams
- Post-deploy smoke tester node in DevOps subgraph (#25): HTTP `/health` check for backends, Telethon `/start` check for tg_bot modules
- `SmokeTesterNode` with retry logic (3 retries, 5s delay) and graceful skip when Telethon not configured
- `smoke_result` field in `DevOpsState` — propagated through deploy_worker to task result
- Conditional routing: `deployer` → `smoke_tester` → END (skips smoke on deploy failure)
- Telethon dependency + env vars in deploy-worker compose config
- Updated `/e2e-run` skill to report smoke results

### Changed
- Extract `infra_client.py` (279 LOC) from langgraph + infra-service to `shared/clients/` (#23)
- Merge duplicated constants (`Paths`, `Timeouts`, `CI`, `Provisioning`) into `shared/constants.py` (#23)
- Service-local `config/constants.py` now re-exports from shared (#23)
- Add `shared/tests/**` to ruff PLR2004/S101 per-file-ignores (#23)
- Restructure ROADMAP: split Phase 2 → 2A (pre-MVP alpha blockers) + 2B (post-alpha stability)
- Triage: 7 new tasks (#30-#35), reopened #25 as regression, reordered backlog by roadmap phases
- New brainstorm: epic decomposition — decision: Task Store in DB (Phase 3), skip intermediate file-based epics
- Triage skill: added Queue reorder step based on ROADMAP phase priorities

## 2026-03-04

### Added
- Auto-detect stale worker images: source hash label in `worker-base-common`, `check-worker-images` target in Makefile, auto-rebuild in `make build` and E2E pre-flight
  - Root cause: `POSTGRES_HOST=project-db` bug persisted 4 E2E runs because `shared/` fix was never baked into worker image ([worker audit](e2e_results/todo_api-20260304-levelC-worker.md))
- LangGraph integration tests (#6): 3 tests against real DB/Redis/API (engineering worker flow, missing project, scaffold_failed abort)
- Engineering-worker service in backend test compose
- API data seeding fixtures (`seed_project`, `seed_task`, `seed_server`) + `poll_task_status` helper
- E2E reports: todo_api Level C PASS (14 min), weather_bot Level C PASS (15 min, first multi-module test)
