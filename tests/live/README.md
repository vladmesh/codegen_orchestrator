# Live harness contract

Pipeline tests create one `OwnershipManifest` per run. The manifest is written under
`.live-manifests/` and records exact project, GitHub repository, Redis entry, port allocation and
server deployment identifiers as they become known. Teardown addresses only those identifiers.
It never deletes a shared Redis stream, scans all configured servers or matches resources by the
historical `live-test-*` prefix.

Cleanup is part of the test result. Every delete command must succeed and each owned resource must
then be observed as absent. A delete or verification error fails the run, including when the test
body already failed.

Scaffold stream deletion is not treated as cancellation. Teardown first writes a project-specific
cancel marker and waits for the scaffolder's active marker to disappear. The consumer checks the
cancel marker before external work and again after publishing its active marker. External deletion
and residue verification start only after claimed scaffold work is quiescent.

The repository root is derived from `tests/live/live_harness.py`. `ORCHESTRATOR_ROOT` may override
it, but the target must contain `pyproject.toml` and `tests/live`.

The full pipeline has a separate post-deploy gate. Once the application is `running`, the harness
starts a health-only QA observation against `/health` and `/v1/health`. It accepts only the terminal
contract `status=completed` with `qa_outcome=passed`. An unreachable endpoint, a non-200 response or
timeout makes the live run red. This gate does not publish to `qa:queue` and does not run an LLM.
